        <h2>The Art of Seasonal Adaptation</h2>
        <p>Traditional cuisines developed around seasonal availability of ingredients, creating natural rhythms of eating that optimize nutrition and flavor. Learning to adapt global recipes using local, seasonal ingredients enhances both sustainability and health benefits.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Seasonal Eating</h2>
