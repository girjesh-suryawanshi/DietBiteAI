 I want to redesign the PDF to make it modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing. Please apply the following improvements to the PDF layout generation code:

🔖 1. Add Cover Page
Title: "FitBite Personalized Meal Plan"

Include:

User Name, Goal, Week Date Range

Short tagline: “Smart AI Diet Plans. Culturally Relevant. Scientifically Balanced.”

Optional logo placeholder

🧍 2. Profile Section (After Cover Page)
Use a two-column layout:

Left Column:

Name, Age, Gender, Height, Weight

Right Column:

Activity Level, Region, Preferred Foods, Health Conditions

Add a BMI auto-calculation and health note if weight/height is abnormal

🗓️ 3. Weekly Meal Plan Layout
Display each day in a bordered box/card format

Each meal (breakfast/lunch/dinner) should use this 3-block structure:

markdown
Copy
Edit
-----------------------------------------------
🍽️  [Meal Name]      🕗 [Time]     🔥 [Calories]
-----------------------------------------------
📋 Ingredients:
- item 1
- item 2

👨‍🍳 Instructions:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
-----------------------------------------------
Use emoji/icons or styled divs to separate each section

Add spacing and padding between days and meals for clean readability

🎨 4. Visual & Design Elements
Use a clean, modern font (e.g., Open Sans, Poppins)

Highlight Day Headers (e.g., MONDAY) using soft background color (light green or light blue)

Use consistent font hierarchy:

Day Header: 18pt bold

Meal Name: 16pt bold

Ingredients/Instructions: 12pt regular

Calories & Time: 10pt italic or gray

Add light dividers between meals and days

Add a simple footer on each page:

“📱 Generated by FitBite | www.fitbite.ai”

📊 5. Weekly Nutrition Summary Table (Optional but preferred)
At the end of the PDF:

🛒 6. Add Grocery List (Optional)
At the end, include an auto-generated weekly grocery list, grouped by:

Vegetables

Grains & Pulses

Dairy

Spices
